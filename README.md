# Spreadsheet Challenge

This app has been developed to take the information found on my public spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JQVnvkzptgX57MfdMGVUB4wH5BYkoANsiqXJsoLfV6k/edit#gid=0 ,
calculates the average grade of every student and informs them if they passed or not. If not, it tells them why, and how much they need to pass.
